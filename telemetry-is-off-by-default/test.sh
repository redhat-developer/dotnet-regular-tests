# This test ensures telemetry is not being sent for (some) commands by
# checking that no network connections are being made when not
# expected. Relies on strace and IF_NET to detect network connections.
#
# A more robust version would be to use tcpdump to check for network
# connections on each command, but this is harder to do without root
# access.
